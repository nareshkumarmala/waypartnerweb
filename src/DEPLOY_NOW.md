## 📱 After Git Push - Monitor Vercel Deployment

**1. Check Vercel Dashboard:**
- Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Look for new deployment starting automatically
- Watch build logs for success messages

**2. Expected Build Log Messages:**
```
✅ Starting Vercel build...
✅ TypeScript check... SUCCESS
✅ Vite build... SUCCESS  
✅ Build verification... SUCCESS
✅ dist directory created successfully
```

**3. If Build Succeeds:**
- Add environment variables: VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- Site will switch from demo mode to production mode
- Green banner will appear: "🟢 Live System: Real-time bookings active"

---

## 🔧 Environment Variables Setup (After Successful Build)

**Go to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables**

Add these two variables:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL = [Your Supabase URL]
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = [Your Supabase Anon Key]
```

**Then redeploy:**
- Deployments → Latest → Redeploy

## 🎯 Verification Steps

**1. Check Live Site:**
- Visit: https://service.waypartnerindia.com
- Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+R

**2. Look for Success Indicators:**
```
✅ Green banner: "Live System: Real-time bookings active"
✅ Console log: "App Version: 2025-01-30-CACHE-FIX"  
✅ Console log: "Production Mode - Connected to Supabase"
✅ No TypeScript or build errors
```

**3. If Still Issues:**
- Run locally: `npm run check` (checks live deployment)
- Follow: `CACHE_CLEARING_GUIDE.md`
